## What is Vispyr

Vispyr is an open-source, easy to install observability tool that brings continuous profiling to small development teams by combining profiles with traditional telemetry data to provide code-level insights into an application’s performance. It simplifies the setup and configuration of an observability platform by automating the deployment of a self-hosted backend on AWS.

Vispyr fills an unmet need by providing open-source developer tooling to orchestrate the various components of an observability platform without the need for prior experience. This case study will provide a detailed explanation of how Vispyr was designed and built, including the technical design decisions made throughout the process, and Vispyr’s place within the observability landscape.
