## What is Vispyr

Vispyr is an open-source easy to install observability tool that brings continuous profiling to small development teams by combining profiles with traditional telemetry signals to connect runtime data to the exact code impacting an application’s performance. It simplifies the set-up and configuration of an observability platform by automating the deployment of a self-hosted backend on AWS.

Vispyr fills an unmet need by providing open-source developer tooling to orchestrate the various components of an observability platform without the need for prior experience. This case study will explain in more detail how Vispyr was designed and built, the technical design decisions made throughout the process, and Vispyr’s place within the observability landscape.
